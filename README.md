This is a mostly-complete Lua wrapper for [libev](), a high performance
C event loop library.

[libev]: http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libev.html

The following watchers are currently supported:

  + child
  + fork
  + idle
  + io
  + periodic
  + signal
  + stat
  + timer

While this library is not yet documented (it's still a work in
progress), the interface closely follows the C interface, so [its
documentation][doc] will be helpful. For further info, see the included
test files.
